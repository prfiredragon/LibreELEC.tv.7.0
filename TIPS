ERRROR Message:
! [remote rejected] master -> master (shallow update not allowed)
	
If you are pushing to a repo that is a bit behind whatever repo you cloned from, not creating an all-new repo, it is enough that your local reference is deep enough to contain
 the remote reference. So if your origin/master was 20 commits ahead of your oldrepo/master when you clone --depth 1'ed it, and you have made 17 local commits since, it is
 enough for you to do git fetch --depth 37 origin refs/heads/BranchName:refs/remotes/origin/BranchName (apologies for any off-by-one error), and then you can do git push oldrepo master
 without incident (may require git 1.9.0 or newer)
